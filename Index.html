    <p>Hello! My name is Peter Nkonge. A family man, that enjoys listening to music, learning new things and always willing to give a helping hand where i can.Technology to me means applying and using tools to create efficiency in something we are engaged in.By going through this training, i hope to build a skill that will give me the understanding of how technology works, when and how to apply it. With an end goal of using those skills to transition into a career in tech.</p>
